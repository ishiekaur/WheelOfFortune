**Wheel of Fortune Bot**

**Overview**

The Wheel of Fortune Bot is an automated version of the classic word-guessing game "Wheel of Fortune." In this implementation, the bot guesses letters to reveal a hidden phrase chosen randomly from a list of phrases. The game provides 5 incorrect guesses before the bot loses. The bot uses random letter generation and tracks previous guesses to avoid duplicates. The main objective is to guess all letters in the phrase correctly before running out of guesses. This project highlights basic concepts of game logic, file handling, and string manipulation in Java.

To deploy and run the Wheel of Fortune Bot application, follow these steps:

Setup:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
